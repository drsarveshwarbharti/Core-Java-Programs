Exception Handling in Java

1. Fundamentals of Exception Handling
🔹 What is an Exception?

An exception is an unexpected event or error that disrupts the normal flow of a program during execution.

Examples:

Dividing by zero

Accessing an invalid array index

Opening a file that doesn’t exist

If not handled properly, such errors can crash the program.

🔹 Purpose of Exception Handling

To maintain normal program flow even when runtime errors occur.

To handle runtime errors gracefully.

To separate error-handling code from normal business logic.

🔹 Keywords Used
Keyword	Description
try	Contains code that may throw an exception.
catch	Handles the exception that occurs in the try block.
finally	Contains code that always executes (cleanup code).
throw	Used to explicitly throw an exception.
throws	Declares exceptions that a method can throw.


2. Exception Types

Java exceptions are classified into two main types:

A. Checked Exceptions

Checked at compile time.

Must be either caught or declared using throws.

Example:

IOException

SQLException

FileNotFoundException

Example:

try {
    FileReader file = new FileReader("data.txt");
} catch (FileNotFoundException e) {
    System.out.println("File not found!");
}

B. Unchecked Exceptions (Runtime Exceptions)

Checked at runtime.

Usually caused by logical errors or careless programming.

Example:

ArithmeticException

ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException

NullPointerException

Example:

int a = 10, b = 0;
System.out.println(a / b); // Throws ArithmeticException

C. Errors

Serious issues not meant to be handled by applications.

Example: OutOfMemoryError, StackOverflowError.



3. Uncaught Exceptions

If an exception occurs and is not caught, the Java Runtime Environment (JRE):

Creates an exception object.

Looks for a matching catch block.

If no handler is found → program terminates abnormally.

Example:

public class UncaughtExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int a = 5 / 0;  // Uncaught ArithmeticException
        System.out.println("This line won't execute");
    }
}


Output:

Exception in thread "main" java.lang.ArithmeticException: / by zero


4. try–catch Block
Syntax:
try {
    // Code that might throw an exception
} catch (ExceptionType e) {
    // Code to handle the exception
}

Example:
public class TryCatchDemo {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        try {
            int num = 10 / 0;
        } catch (ArithmeticException e) {
            System.out.println("Error: Cannot divide by zero!");
        }
        System.out.println("Program continues normally...");
    }
}


Output:

Error: Cannot divide by zero!
Program continues normally...

Summary Table
Concept	Description
Checked Exception	Checked at compile time (e.g., IOException)
Unchecked Exception	Occurs at runtime (e.g., ArithmeticException)
Error	Serious problem not handled by program (e.g., OutOfMemoryError)
try–catch	Used to handle exceptions safely
Uncaught Exception	No handler → program terminates abnormally
