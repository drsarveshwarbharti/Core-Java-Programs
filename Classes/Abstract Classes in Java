Abstract Classes in Java
💡 1. Definition

An abstract class in Java is a class that is declared using the keyword abstract and cannot be instantiated (i.e., you cannot create objects directly from it).
It is meant to serve as a base class for other classes.

It may contain:

Abstract methods (without implementation)

Concrete methods (with implementation)

Syntax:
abstract class ClassName {
    abstract void display(); // Abstract method (no body)
    void show() {            // Concrete method
        System.out.println("This is a concrete method.");
    }
}

🧠 2. Key Points About Abstract Classes
Concept	Explanation
Keyword	Declared using abstract keyword.
Object Creation	Cannot be instantiated directly.
Purpose	Used to provide a common base class for subclasses.
Methods	May contain both abstract and non-abstract methods.
Constructors	Can have constructors (called during subclass instantiation).
Inheritance	Must be extended by another class that provides implementation for abstract methods.
Abstract Method Rule	If a class has even one abstract method, it must be declared abstract.
⚙️ 3. Example: Abstract Class with Implementation
// Abstract class
abstract class Shape {
    abstract void draw();  // Abstract method

    void display() {       // Concrete method
        System.out.println("This is a shape.");
    }
}

// Subclass implementing abstract method
class Circle extends Shape {
    void draw() {
        System.out.println("Drawing a Circle...");
    }
}

// Driver class
public class AbstractDemo {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Shape s = new Shape(); // ❌ Not allowed (cannot instantiate)
        Shape s = new Circle();   // ✅ Allowed (reference to subclass)
        s.display();
        s.draw();
    }
}

Output:
This is a shape.
Drawing a Circle...

🧩 4. Why Use Abstract Classes?
Reason	Explanation
Common base	Provides a template or base for other classes.
Partial abstraction	Allows both abstract and concrete methods.
Code reusability	Common code can be kept in the abstract class.
Polymorphism	Abstract class references can refer to subclass objects.
🔹 5. Abstract Class vs Interface
Feature	Abstract Class	Interface
Keyword	abstract	interface
Methods	Abstract + Concrete	All abstract (Java 7); can have default/static (Java 8+)
Variables	Can have any type	Always public static final
Inheritance	Supports single inheritance	Supports multiple inheritance
Constructor	Can have constructors	Cannot have constructors
🔸 6. Example with Constructor and Variables
abstract class Vehicle {
    String brand;

    Vehicle(String brand) {   // Constructor
        this.brand = brand;
    }

    abstract void start();

    void showBrand() {
        System.out.println("Brand: " + brand);
    }
}

class Car extends Vehicle {
    Car(String brand) {
        super(brand);
    }

    void start() {
        System.out.println(brand + " Car is starting...");
    }
}

public class VehicleDemo {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Vehicle v = new Car("Toyota");
        v.showBrand();
        v.start();
    }
}


Output:

Brand: Toyota
Toyota Car is starting...

✅ 7. Summary
Concept	Description
Abstract Class	A class that cannot be instantiated directly.
Abstract Method	Method without implementation, defined in subclass.
Use Case	When base class provides common functionality and forces subclass to define specific behavior.
Supports	Partial abstraction and code reusability.
