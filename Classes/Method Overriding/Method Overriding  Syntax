/*
Method Overriding occurs when a subclass (child class) provides a specific 
implementation of a method that is already defined in its superclass (parent class).
It allows a subclass to modify or enhance the behavior inherited from the parent class.
🔹 Purpose
To achieve runtime polymorphism.
To provide specific behavior for subclass objects.
